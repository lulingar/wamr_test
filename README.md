# wamr_test

## Motivation
This example serves to explore WAMR's behavior when spawning more than one instance of the same module, while options such as shared memory or multi-module support are toggled.

## Get started

Compare executing 
```
make run_no_thread
```

with 
```
make run_threaded
```

There are also `gdb_*` corresponding targets, to be used for debugging.
